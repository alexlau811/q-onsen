## Game Tips

- Start by building at least one onsen pool to attract guests
- Hire enough staff to run your facilities - higher skill levels provide better service but cost more
- Balance your entry fee - too high will drive guests away, too low won't generate enough profit
- Different seasons affect guest numbers - winter is peak season for onsen resorts
- Keep your pools clean and at optimal temperature (38-42°C) for best guest satisfaction
- Marketing campaigns can help boost your reputation and attract more guests
- Watch your finances carefully and don't expand too quickly
- Different customer types have different preferences - try to cater to a variety of guests
- Pay attention to customer feedback to improve your resort

## Game Controls

The game is entirely text-based. Navigate through menus by entering the number corresponding to your choice.

For convenience, simply pressing Enter without typing anything will advance to the next day.

Enjoy managing your onsen resort!
