# Onsen Resort Management Game - Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive test cases for the Onsen Resort Management Game to ensure functionality and evaluate game balance.

## Test Files

### 1. `game_validation.py` - Main Validation Script ‚≠ê
**Recommended for quick validation**
- Tests all core game functionality
- Validates imports and object creation
- Tests game mechanics and balance
- Confirms advanced features work
- **Run this first to verify the game is working**

```bash
python3 game_validation.py
```

### 2. `silent_test.py` - Balance Analysis
- Tests different resort scenarios without user input
- Analyzes profitability of minimal, balanced, and premium setups
- Provides detailed financial analysis
- Good for evaluating game balance

```bash
python3 silent_test.py
```

### 3. `test_onsen_game.py` - Comprehensive Unit Tests
- Full unittest suite for all game components
- Tests edge cases and error conditions
- Includes scenario-based balance testing
- More detailed but takes longer to run

```bash
python3 -m unittest test_onsen_game.py
```

### 4. `quick_test.py` - Interactive Test (Requires Input)
- Tests with actual game interface
- Shows customer feedback and daily summaries
- Good for seeing the game in action
- **Note: Requires pressing Enter to advance**

```bash
python3 quick_test.py
```

## Test Results Summary

### ‚úÖ Core Functionality - WORKING

### ‚öñÔ∏è Game Balance Analysis

**Test Results (10-day simulation):**

| Scenario | Investment | Profit | ROI | Status |
|----------|------------|--------|-----|--------|
| Minimal Resort | Low | ¬•709,000 | 709% | ‚úÖ Profitable |
| Balanced Resort | Medium | ¬•1,457,000 | 1457% | ‚úÖ Profitable |
| Premium Resort | High | ¬•6,201,500 | 6201% | ‚úÖ Profitable |

**Key Findings:**
- All scenarios are profitable
- Higher investment yields significantly higher returns
- Premium setup reaches 100% reputation
- Game progression feels rewarding

### üîß Technical Issues Fixed
- **Staff Salary Calculation**: Fixed index out of range error for skill levels 6-10
- **Event System**: Fixed method name mismatch (`generate_event` ‚Üí `trigger_random_event`)
- **Constructor Parameters**: Fixed parameter mismatches in OnsenPool, Restaurant, and GiftShop
- **Import Issues**: Resolved all module import problems

## How to Use These Tests

### For Developers:
1. Run `game_validation.py` after any code changes
2. Use `silent_test.py` to check balance after gameplay modifications
3. Run the full test suite with `test_onsen_game.py` for comprehensive validation

### For Players:
1. Run `game_validation.py` to confirm the game works on your system
2. If you want to see the game in action, try `quick_test.py`

### For Game Balance Evaluation:
1. Use `silent_test.py` for automated balance analysis
2. Modify the test scenarios to try different configurations
3. Check profitability and progression curves

## Test Coverage

- ‚úÖ All game modules import correctly
- ‚úÖ All core classes instantiate properly
- ‚úÖ Game simulation runs without errors
- ‚úÖ Financial calculations work correctly
- ‚úÖ Customer satisfaction system functions
- ‚úÖ Weather and events affect gameplay
- ‚úÖ Staff management system works
- ‚úÖ Facility and pool management works
- ‚úÖ Edge cases handled properly

## Recommendations

**For New Players:**
- Start with minimal setup (1 small pool, entry fee ¬•1000)
- Gradually add facilities and staff
- Monitor reputation - it directly affects guest numbers
- Weather affects guest numbers, plan accordingly

**For Game Balance:**
- Current balance is quite generous (all scenarios very profitable)
- Consider increasing costs or reducing income for more challenge
- Premium setups should feel rewarding (currently working well)

## Running All Tests

To run a complete validation:

```bash
# Quick validation (recommended)
